# Im Swetha.K 👇:
Hey there! Thanks for stopping by to learn a bit about my journey and expertise.<br>I’m a Business and Data Analytics Specialist, transitioning from a Product Executive role, passionate about transforming operational data into business insights that drive measurable efficiency. With 1.5 years of hands-on experience at TCS, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the power of clean, well-governed data in improving business performance.<br>I specialize in using SQL for data validation and governance, and Power BI for tracking production and performance metrics. As a Senior Attribute Tagger, I’ve implemented client-approved process improvements through JIRA, developed pilot project documentation, and trained team members on new workflows. My work spans the entire product readiness cycle — from data verification and Product ID creation (Stella) to asset deployment (Titan/WinSCP) and final page activation.<br>Certified and skilled in SQL Server, Power BI, Tableau, Python, Advanced Excel, EDA Analysis, and Statistics, I’m equally proficient in managing operational workflows using JIRA, Stella, Titan, and WinSCP.<br>I’m driven by one goal: to simplify operational complexity into clear, actionable insights through data visualization and analytics — making data more accessible, insightful, and valuable for business growth.<br>
